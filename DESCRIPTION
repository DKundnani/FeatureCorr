Description: R package for performing correlation analysis to find features/variables having similar degree of associations. The Package includes data preprocessing to transform the data and filtering out missing values,correlation of one feature with all features in an R dataframe. It also includes multiple and single pairwise correlation of a feature value Dataframe.
